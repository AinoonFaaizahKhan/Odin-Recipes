    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a classic Italian-American comfort dish featuring tender seasoned chicken and pasta—most traditionally fettuccine—tossed in a rich, velvety sauce made of butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g / 7oz chicken breast, cut in half horizontally</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>250 g / 8 oz fettuccine</li>
        <li>2 cups milk, any fat %</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock / broth</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup thickened / heavy cream (Note 1)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup freshly grated parmesan (Note 2)</li>
        <li>Parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Use a skillet large enough to fit the pasta.</li>
        <li>Heat oil over medium high heat. Add chicken and cook for 2 minutes on each side until golden and cooked through. Remove onto plate and rest for 5 minutes, then slice while pasta is cooking.</li>
        <li>Add milk, chicken broth and garlic. Bring to simmer then add pasta.</li>
        <li>Move pasta around every 30 seconds or so until it is softened (around 3 minutes) so it doesn’t stick. Once pasta is softened, reduce heat to medium and stir every couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>At about 9 – 10 minutes, the pasta should be almost cooked but there should still be liquid covering the base of the skillet. Add cream and parmesan and mix.</li>
        <li>Simmer, stirring occasionally, for ~2 minutes, until sauce is thickened and pasta is cooked. If you cook it too long and the sauce goes gluggy, add a splash of hot tap water – will go back to silky with a few tosses.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately, garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley!</li>
    </ol>
