    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Menemen is a popular, traditional Turkish one-pan dish of eggs scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, and onions, seasoned with spices and cooked in olive oil, often served for breakfast with crusty bread. It's known for its rich, creamy texture, achieved by gently stirring eggs into a tomato-pepper base, and can be customized with cheese, herbs, or sausage.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper (Anaheim or Holland peppers will work as well), cored, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 vine-ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, more for later</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes, optional if you like spicy</li>
        <li>1 French baguette for serving thickly sliced (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 10-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers and season with kosher salt. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly until softened (being careful not to brown the onions).</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with a little more kosher salt, black pepper, oregano, and Aleppo pepper. Cook for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften but still hold their shape (5 to 7 minutes).</li>
        <li>Push the tomato and pepper mixture to one side of the pan. Lower the heat to medium-low. Add the beaten egg, and cook briefly, stirring gently as needed, until the eggs are just set. Fold the tomato mixture into the eggs.</li>
        <li>Finish with a little EVOO and more Aleppo pepper and crushed red pepper flakes, if you need a little kick. Serve immediately with thick slices of bread.</li>
